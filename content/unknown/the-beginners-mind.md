Don't give in to your ego, be honest about what you don't know. Most problems exist only because the right questions are yet to be asked.

### Step outside your event loop 

Take a break from your problem domain by taking connecting with the world outside that is not concerned with your obsessions.

Doing something physically repetitive seems to be a great way to make break through so go give the lawnmower a spin.
